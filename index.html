    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">Securing a website from web security attacks requires a multifaceted approach, involving several best practices. Here are a few recommendations to start with:
      <br>
        •	Use HTTPS protocol: Use HTTPS protocol to encrypt communications between the website and the user's browser. This helps to prevent data interception and tampering by attackers.
        <br>
        •	Keep software updated: Keep all software and frameworks updated, including the website's content management system (CMS) and plugins, to ensure they are free from known security vulnerabilities.
        <br>
        •	Use strong passwords: Strong passwords should be used for all user accounts associated with the website, including administrators, and should be changed regularly. Passwords should be complex and unique to each account.
        <br>
        •	Limit access: Limit access to sensitive parts of the website to authorized personnel only. This includes limiting file permissions, database access, and restricting access to administrative areas.
        <br>
        •	Use security tools: Use security tools such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and anti-virus software to prevent and detect attacks.
        <br>
        •	Regular backups: Regularly backup website files and data to avoid data loss in the event of a security breach or system failure.
        <br>
        •	Educate users: Educate users about safe browsing practices, such as avoiding suspicious emails and links, and updating their software regularly.
        <br>
        •	Implementing these measures can improve your website's security posture and reduce the risk of web security attacks
